# Project Readme

This project is a chatbot that uses the open API OpenAI to generate text and images based on user queries. The bot is capable of generating text using GPT-3 and images using DALL-E.

## Usage

To start using the bot, send a message with your query to the bot's chat. If you want to request an image generation, use the /image command and the bot will prompt you to enter your idea for image generation.
